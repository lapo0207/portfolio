        <h1>Who Am I</h1>
        <p>My names Anisia Laporte, I am born and raised in Ottawa Ontario From a young age, Iâ€™ve always had a passion for cosmetics and beauty. I started learning and self teaching from the age of 10, it quickly became one of my favourite hobbies. One thing I enjoy most about this hobby, is being able to help other who may be struggling to learn. I began practicing on my younger sister, we spent hours doing all sorts of hairstyles and makeup looks. Now I want to continue sharing what I know with others.</p>
