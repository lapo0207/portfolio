I chose to design a promotional brand. I created a webiste for the brand Garden Beauty. It is a self promotional cosmetics brand.  A few challenges I had was moving the text next to all my images. A way I fixed it was floating it, using grid, and positioning. While creating this website, it helped me become more comfortable with using positioning and creating a nav bar. I always struggled to make the navbar.
